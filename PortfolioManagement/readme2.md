# Portfolio Management Web Application

## Title
Portfolio Management: Interactive Stock Trading and Tracking Platform

## Objective of Project
To create a standalone, user-friendly web application that allows investors to monitor their stock portfolios, execute trades, and receive investment recommendations through an intuitive interface. The project aims to deliver a fully responsive solution using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with client-side data persistence and without dependencies on external frameworks or libraries.

## Problem Statement
Individual investors face several challenges when managing their portfolios:
- Difficulty tracking investments across multiple platforms
- Limited access to comprehensive trading tools without subscription fees
- Lack of personalized investment recommendations
- Concerns about data privacy and security
- Need for consistent access across different devices

Current solutions in the market are often overly complex, expensive, or fail to provide a cohesive experience that combines portfolio tracking, trading functionality, and personalized insights in one accessible platform.

## Conclusion/Outcome
The Portfolio Management web application successfully delivers a comprehensive solution that addresses the identified challenges through:

1. A secure, localStorage-based authentication system with basic encryption
2. An interactive dashboard featuring live stock price updates and portfolio valuation
3. Intuitive trading interfaces for buying and selling stocks with automatic balance management
4. Sector-based stock recommendations to guide investment decisions
5. Fully responsive design ensuring seamless functionality across desktop and mobile devices

The implementation demonstrates that effective portfolio management tools can be built with fundamental web technologies, providing investors with a lightweight yet powerful platform to manage their investments independently. The application achieves its goal of combining security, functionality, and ease of use in a single, framework-free solution that runs entirely in the browser.
